Hey! I'm Saumya, a Bachelor's graduate interested in Computer Science, AI, philosophy, consciousness, notions of productivity, lifestyles, social phenomena, music, art, movies, love and just the experience of being human. This blog should reflect my very complex scattered opinions on all of these.

I am an aspiring researcher always working on interesting projects. Currently I am a Software Engineering Intern at American Express. Before this, I was a Research Scholar at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, Germany. There, I was a research intern in the Data Systems Group (DSG), led by Prof Laurent Bindschaedler.

My current research interests are drawn into 2 subfields: 

**AI Alignment** which covers Finetuning, RAG, Reasoning in LLMs, Chain of Thoughts (single, or multiple), Agentic Systems, RLHF, Self-Improvement and different sorts of alignment.

Then there is **Applications of AI** which broadly covers Multilingual AI, Code LMs, Code Embedding Models, Code retrieval, all of which covers my latest work "LoRACode: LoRA Adapters for Code Embeddings". There is also Math LMs and a deep interest for NeuroAI and brain encoding/decoding, which I eventually aim to dig my hands in.
